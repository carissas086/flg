The scene takes place in a Giant Cloud with the Cross visible within it.</p>

                            <p class="verse"><sup>4 </sup>The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us. We have seen His Glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>

                        <p>After completing the smaller cloud with the children&apos;s verse for Sunday school preparation, I prayed for a dream of Heaven, as I was missing my Mom who had passed, and I was carrying a heavy cross myself.</p>
                        <p>Instead of a dream of Heaven, I dreamt of Jesus on earth. For years I didn&apos;t understand the dream. All I remember was that Jesus was everywhere at the same time: in a field, on the childhood street, carrying the cross in a storm, and helping me craft with chocolate hearts.</p>
