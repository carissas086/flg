                        <p>God&apos;s grace for us is between our time of &ldquo;remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return&rdquo; (Genesis 3:19b), so we &ldquo;repent and believe in the Gospel&rdquo; (Mark 1:15b).</p>
                        <p>Through Jesus we can be forgiven and set free from the bondage of sins: soar high under God&apos;s love with a bird&apos;s-eye view to survey the landscapes of our hearts that have developed over time, prayerfully reorient our journeys of &ldquo;let go and let God&rdquo; (cf. Ephesians 3:20) in which our beings are to be transformed, then our relationship with God and people will be renewed, and our doings will be manifested organically, being filled with the fruit of the Holy Spirit (cf. Galatians 5:22-23)</p>
