                        <p>This watercolor piece displays both the positive and negative elements of the death and resurrection of Jesus. The light that splits both dark and happiness illustrates how God can create joy in the dark and bitterness in our lives, how he gives us hope in grace so that we don&apos;t have to worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow has its own to worry about.</p>
