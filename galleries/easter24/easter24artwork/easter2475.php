                        <p>Easter is specially a meaningful time as it commemorates the suffering and death of Jesus, as well as the resurrection. &ldquo;We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.&rdquo; (Roman 6:4) This drawing has portrayed the stunning moment when our Lord died on the cross. The moment that His life on earth was flashing back. It was a life of legend that was full of God&apos;s miracles one by one, and His love to the people is tremendous.</p>
                        <p><span html lang="zh-Hant">復活節紀念了主耶穌的受難和復活, 特別具意義 。「我們藉著洗禮歸入死, 和衪一同埋葬, 原是叫我們一舉一動有新生的樣式, 像基督藉著父的榮耀從死裡復活一樣。」羅馬書6:4   這幅畫想像了基督死在十字架時的情景。在那一個舜間, 正回顧着主耶穌在世的一生事蹟。這一生不單只是充滿神蹟和奇事而且亦顯明了他對人們的大愛。</span></p>
