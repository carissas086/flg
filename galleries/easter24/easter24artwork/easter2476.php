                        <p>This artwork captures the scenery after the crucifixion of Jesus when Mary went to look at the tomb. When Mary entered the tomb, she encountered an angel who came from heaven and the angel said to Mary &ldquo;Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where He lay&rdquo; (New International Version, 1978, Matthew 28:5). After Mary encounter with the angel, she was filled with joy and spread this great news to Jesus&apos;s disciples.</p>
