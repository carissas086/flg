        <h3>Reflecting on the Season of Lent</h3>
        <p>The season of lent marks a time of preparation for Easter weekend. It echoes the Lord's time in the wilderness, and is a time for penitence, fasting, and prayer in preparation for the great feast of the resurrection. This exhibit serves as a companion to our journey through these 40 days. The hope is that by hearing and answering our Saviour's call to repent, we may enter fully into the Easter celebration.</p>
