                        <p>This painting came from a private time with Jesus &mdash; wherein while coming alongside the Spirit in intercession, I was invited to press in and come closer.</p>
                        <p>It was a magical moment of intimacy where I not only had permission to initiate physical contact but felt compelled to. It flipped my how-we-&ldquo;get&rdquo;-to-interact-with-Jesus schema inside out, and birthed a new way for me to relate to Him. This revelation also came following an Easter weekend years ago. And as I was painting, I was led to scaffold His sacrifice into this Jesus moment I had to layer my reflection. This Jesus, who gave Himself up for us, invites us into intimacy with Him. How stunning is that?</p>
