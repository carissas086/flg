                        <p>Can you guess where this painting was inspired? During a badminton session at church. It was raining outside and pitch black &mdash; I couldn&apos;t even see past the trees that were loosely silhouetted.</p>
                        <p>A series of questions popped into my head: <span class="italics">What if waiting for Jesus to rise from the dead was like this? Dark, hopeless, dreary, exhausting, bleak, gloomy. How do we respond to the &ldquo;light at the end of the tunnel&rdquo; that we can&apos;t see? What if waiting for Jesus to return is like this?</span></p>
                        <p>That was the moment where God started talking to me not only about hope, but waiting in hope. He reminded me of the abundance of His promises that help us while we wrestle with the tension of the not-yet. How do you wait in hope?</p>
