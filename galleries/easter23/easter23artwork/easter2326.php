                        <p>The black background of this work represents a world that&apos;s often dark, grief ridden &amp; sorrowful with much suffocating pressure and oppression.</p>
                        <p>The bubbles are meant to depict either us as individuals, with our own life experiences, or us as members of a community grappling with life as above.</p>
                        <p>The colors inside those bubbles signify times of extreme suffering and pain but are broken through and filled with joy and light by Jesus&apos; suffering, death and resurrection.</p>
                        <p>The golden metallic thread symbolizes the Holy Spirit, who connects our individual experiences, giving us encouragement &amp; power to live and serve each other and our Most High God all the days of our lives.</p>
