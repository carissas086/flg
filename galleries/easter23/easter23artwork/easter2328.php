                        <p>I will say that this painting idea just came to mind as soon as I thought about Easter, the two items the bread and the cup came into mind first. Lots of people call the cup and bread differently like the wine was never called wine in the bible. Some evidence is in Mark 14:25 and Luke 22:18 it says that the wine is &ldquo;the fruit of the vine&rdquo; and in 1 Corinthians 10:16 it says &ldquo;the cup of blessing, which we bless.&rdquo;</p>
