                        <p>We live because Jesus died. Baptism identifies us with Christ in His death and resurrection, portraying our whole life as a dying to self and living for and in Him who died for us <span class="italics">(Galatians 2:20)</span>. However, are we actually taking up the cross and following Christ? Have our old self fully put to death, especially the sinful ways and lifestyles we once engaged in? Or are we the lukewarm followers who try to live partly in the old life and partly in the new as those whom He will spit out <span class="italics">(Revelation 3:15&ndash;16)</span>. As a Christian, death to self is not an option, it is a lifelong process and it is the only choice that leads to eternal life.</p>
