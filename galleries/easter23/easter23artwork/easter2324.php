                        <p>The &ldquo;Legend of the Sand Dollar&rdquo; was planted in my heart in 2003, in Tofino, BC, while I was expecting my first child. This beautiful sea creature illustrates the birth and death of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ so well.  This clear oil painting was first exhibited in Fraser Lands Church during our last Christmas Exhibit in 2019 &lpar;alongside the &ldquo;Hearing God&rdquo; Christmas tree&rpar;, just before the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. Just as the artist is viewing it through her new cataract-free-eyes, please enjoy this painting through an &ldquo;Easter 2023&rdquo; lens.</p>
