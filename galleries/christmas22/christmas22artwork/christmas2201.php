                        <p>I wanted to capture my relationship with Jesus over my life so far and how the story of his birth draws me in. The dark clouds embody the difficulties I faced in the earlier years of my life. The pink clouds are dots of His outpouring of love towards me and the bright white moon - the only element with dimension - is symbolic of his pure goodness and love and how it is the center of my life. My journey continues forward towards the light and freedom.</p>
