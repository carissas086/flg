                        <p>This painting is a symbol of kindness and caring, of the newborn that brought us eternal life, and of the Lord's grace for us all. In Jeremiah 8:7 (NIV) it says,</p>
                        <div class="verse-box">
                            <p class="verse"><sup>7 </sup>Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed seasons, &lsqb;&hellip;&rsqb;. But my people do not know the requirements of the Lord.</p>
                            <p class="ref">Jeremiah 8:7 [NIV]</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>We are reminded how we often wander away from our Lord but just as the stork knows to always return to the same nest every migratory season, so our Lord brought us His Son, to show us the way to Him.</p>
