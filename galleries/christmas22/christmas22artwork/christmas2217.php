                        <p>This painting is called &ldquo;The Light&rdquo; the reason I named this from the inspiration saying &ldquo;I am the Light of the World&rdquo; from the &ldquo;I am&rdquo;. There are two versions of verses; one in Matthew 5:14-16 and one in John 8:12, both of these verses Jesus said but one of them says &ldquo;you are the light of the world&rdquo; and the other says &ldquo;I am the light of the world&rdquo;. The one I am inspired by is John 8:12, it says</p>

                            <p class="verse"><sup>12 </sup>I am the light of the world.  Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.</p>

                        <p>Jesus was born in a setting where not a typical king or child would be born, he was born in a manger in a  stable in bethlehem but it was a special birth, a birth that the world would know.</p>
