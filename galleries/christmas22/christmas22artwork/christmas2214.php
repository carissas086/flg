                        <p>The Christmas story; like we all know revolves around the birth of Jesus Christ. For some, His birth was just like any other, but for us Christians, we see hope and joy in His arrival. Likewise, while capturing these photos, I was particularly drawn to how God presents himself in my everyday life. For other tourists, this scenery was simply an architectural sight, but for me, it was a reminder of his presence in the quiet moments. The birth of Jesus has given us new life and purpose, and as we carry out our everyday routine, I am encouraged during this season to become more vigilant in the ways he makes himself apparent.</p>
