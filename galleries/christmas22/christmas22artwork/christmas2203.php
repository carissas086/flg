                        <p>The pieces answer the question of the song, &ldquo;What Child is This?&rdquo; The first verse introduces Jesus as a baby worthy of adoration. He was born to bring light to a dark world. The second verse focuses on Jesus as a king deserving of the best offerings. Yet Jesus offered himself as a sacrifice for us. He was a gift to the world that was cradled in a wooden manger as a baby, and later nailed to a wooden cross as our saviour. He gave His life for us and it was the greatest gift of love.</p>
