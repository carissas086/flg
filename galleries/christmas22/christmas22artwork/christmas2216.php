                        <p>I was reflecting on how familiar the characters in the nativity scene are to us, but that we don't often think about how these characters came to make up this beautiful arrival story. I wanted to touch lightly on those unique stories to evoke curiosity for what's happening behind this scene and celebrate the divine way God weaves us together to bring glory to Him.</p>
