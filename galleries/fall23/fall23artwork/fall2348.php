                        <p>In Chapter 3, the three friends refused to worship the statue. As a result, they were thrown into the flaming furnace.  Surprisingly, they were not burned and they came out without any smoke smell. This is a victory. But the victory actually begins when they  boldly replied to King Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 3:18, &ldquo;But even if He doesn&apos;t, we still won&apos;t worship your gods and the gold statue you have set up.&rdquo;  Their faith in God is unwavering, regardless of what may happen.</p>
