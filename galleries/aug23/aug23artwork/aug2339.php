                        <p>This piece is inspired by Naomi&apos;s thanksgiving to God in Ruth 4:14:</p>

                            <p class="verse"><sup>14 </sup>Praise be to the Lord, who this day has not left you without a guardian-redeemer.</p>

                        <p>As Naomi endures trials and uncertainties, her faithfulness to God and invitation for Him to work in her life creates a beautiful narrative of God&apos;s constant presence within the details of her story. Similarly, the photograph portrays God&apos;s omnipresence flourishing in love and peace in the details of the doodles. God uses the story of both Ruth and Naomi as  reminder that even when we don&apos;t see Him at times, God is still working in us and through us.</p>
