                        <p>This painting was of a time when life seemed to be falling apart and I couldn&apos;t hold myself together. The only thing that I could cling to was God&apos;s faithfulness in His love for me that no human can replicate. While I couldn&apos;t see the world outside of the chaos that consumed my vision, He told me&hellip;</p>
                        <p>&hellip;that I am walking on solid ground when He is with me</br>&hellip;that His plans for me and great and glorious beyond what I can imagine</br>&hellip;that He desires to bless me and when I choose to partner with Him, I will thrive.</p>
                        <p>It echoes Ruth&apos;s blind faith and obedience when she could not see what was ahead and did not yet understand what God is putting in place for her.</p>
