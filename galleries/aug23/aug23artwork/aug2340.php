                        <p>Ruth&apos;s character and story feels like a bright ball of light glowing in a pink flower, the purity of her character is like a single stem of bright beauty nestled in the cosmic flowing world we all are a part of. When we look at her story we can&apos;t help but feel drawn in, and we see how God so gently chooses to work in her life and in His own timing. </p>
                        <p>A great reminder of His plans for us.</p>
