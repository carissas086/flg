                        <p>When I read about the theme of God&apos;s covenant love, I envisioned how we sometimes wander away from God, but He is always there trying to pull us back in. I imagined God&apos;s &ldquo;pinky promise&rdquo; to us being tied by an invisible, unbreakable string, tugging at us to return when we&apos;ve strayed too far. We can be enveloped in his love and light if we just turn to His arms that are reaching out for us. In a world where love is uncertain, I found peace knowing that God made me to love Him, and He made me to be loved by Him.</p>
