                        <p>We see God&apos;s <span class="italics">hesed</span> love on display in the Book of Ruth through the loyalty and faithfulness of the individuals in the story.</p>
                        <p>Let me tell you my story. I was not a Christian when I married Paul in 1980, but I went to church with him. And in 1984, I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior. After I was baptized, my mother-in-law told me that she had been praying for my salvation. She continued to show her unmeasurable love towards me by babysitting my children when they were young. In reciprocity, I looked after her at the end of her life. Learning from her faithfulness to the Lord, I have also committed myself to helping people who are in need, especially those who are mentally ill. Shortly after I retired as a community psychiatric nurse, I had a terrible car accident in October last year. Though I have to walk with a cane now, I cannot but praise God for sparing my life and for allowing me to have more quiet time with God in the next two months during my recovery at home when I really felt God&apos;s presence during my deep reflection of my life. By the grace of God, I felt perked up early this year. Then I saw opportunities to help the homeless, kids with challenges and those marginalized in the community. The Book of Ruth continues to encourage me to be a conduit of blessing to those being broken and hurt.</p>
