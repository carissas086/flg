        <p>The term &ldquo;magnificat&rdquo; comes from a latin term, the same term that gave English &ldquo;magnificent&rdquo;. In response to the Christmas story, Mary is in a unique position to praise God. She calls Him magnificent. This Christmas, we will meditate on the glory of God: His brilliance, His magnificence.</p>
