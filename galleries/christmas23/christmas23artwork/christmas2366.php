                        <p>The crown is seen as something for the greater, something that separates worthy from &ldquo;unworthy&rdquo;. But this is the crown that God bestows upon us &mdash; Coheirs with Christ. The lonely, broken, disheartened, angry, and hopeless. We need only to come as we are. And because of who He is, there is strength in the whisper of &ldquo;God I don&apos;t see you but I trust you&rdquo;, beauty in the cry of &ldquo;Prove to me that you are good&rdquo;, and power in choosing to say &ldquo;I am unworthy but thank you&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;When the giant doesn&apos;t fall<br>And Jericho&apos;s still standing tall<br>He&apos;s still good<br>He&apos;s still good <br>When He doesn&apos;t split the sea<br>It&apos;s cuz He sees even better things <br>He&apos;s still good<br>He&apos;s still good&rdquo;</p>
