                        <p>Mary&apos;s song, &ldquo;Magnificat&rdquo;, the song where she sings about how blessed she is, it made me realize how blessed we are too. God has given us many things that we should appreciate and be grateful for.  Even though sometimes we get distracted by worldly things and forget, I do that sometimes, but we should be thankful for our surroundings. In this painting it shows Mary, though it can be anyone, praising and glorifying God through dance. Dance is a form or art, something that we can use our body to express our feelings and emotions just like how Mary praised God in the song &ldquo;Magnificat&rdquo;.</p>
