                        <p>In AWANA we have been learning about &ldquo;God is&hellip;&rdquo;. For our art exhibit piece we went through Luke 1:48&ndash;55 and discussed what each verse told us about God and who He is. Then we drew&sol;wrote about what one of these characteristics means to us personally! May our sharings encourage you to reflect on who God is to you.</p>
