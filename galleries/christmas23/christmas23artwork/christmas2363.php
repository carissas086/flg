                        <p>As I read in Luke 1:51:</p>
                        <div class="verse-box">
                            <p class="verse"><sup>51 </sup>He has performed mighty deeds with His arm;<br>He has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.</p>
                            <p class="ref">Luke 1:51 [NIV]</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>It reminded me of a memory verse we recently taught in AWANA from Jeremiah 10:12:</p>
                        <div class="verse-box">
                            <p class="verse"><sup>12 </sup>But God made the earth by His power;<br>He founded the world by His wisdom<br>and stretched out the heavens by His understanding.</p>
                            <p class="ref">Jeremiah 10:12 [NIV]</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>For our God is mighty indeed, to create the majestic mountains, the mighty glaciers, and magnificent clouds that paints the sky.</p>
